# VK Internship task

Need to develop a method for finding short title sequences in TV series. Describe the approach you are going to take, and a big plus would be something to try to implement.

A TV series title sequence is a repetitive snippet from episode to episode that relates to the presentation of a given TV series. They come from a few seconds to minutes. Here we are only interested in the short version of the splash screen, which usually only shows the name of the series.
We need to determine the start and end time of such a splash screen.

I will use framework **Pytorch** for this problem.
It wasn't specified if i can use pre-trained modules, so I decided to use a ResNet as cnn module.
